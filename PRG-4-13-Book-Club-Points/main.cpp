//  * If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.
//  * If a customer purchases 1 books, he or she earns 5 points.
//  * If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 15 points.
//  * If a customer purchases 3 books, he or she earns 30 points.
//  * If a customer purchases 4 books or more, he or she earns 60 points.
//
//  Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books he or she has purchesed
//  this month then displays the number of points awarded.
